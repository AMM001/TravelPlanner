                                       FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
                                       - - - - - - - - - - 

According to the present scenario, TravelPlanner is saving all the data that you entered in its database and remembers that for you. 
Later when you open the checklist it gives that data back to you. 
For future puposes, we intend to add the google maps in it so that it also gives you the direction, map, distance and temperature of the destination. 
We need to connect our "Travel From" and "Travel to" to Google Maps so that anybody using the TravelPlanner can directly get the route.    
Here are some more features that we wish to include in our application:

 1)   Addition of google maps.
 2)   Prompt the addition of the items based on the History.
 3)   Can determine the weather condition of the destination.
 4)   Sharing of the checklist through email,mms and bluetooth.
 5)   Display the Direction, map, Temperature and traffic from start to the end of the destination.
 6)   Major attractions of the place of visit could be browsed.
 7)   Add Checklists as Favorites.
